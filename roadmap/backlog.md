# Backlog

Loose tasks pulled from otherwise-shipped features.

- [ ] Remove the obsolete `src/admin/pages/_protected/settings/index.tsx` "Coming soon" placeholder + its sidebar footer link
- [ ] `db:migrate` CLI wrapper (drizzle-kit migrate) — `db:generate` already ships; deferred until a table-shipping first-party plugin needs it
- [ ] Dedicated `GET /search` endpoint + `search()` SDK method — only if a public/programmatic search surface is needed
- [ ] `searchable?: false` opt-out on `EntryTypeConfig` — add when a titled root type should be excluded from search
- [ ] Browser-verify the demo marketing site on port 4323
- [ ] Investigate version history for settings (app-pages + plugin settings pages currently KV-upsert, no revisions) — relevant if settings-backed features (e.g. menus) want revert/history the way entries get it
- [ ] Reconcile entry `destructive` semantics: the manifest (mirroring `entryGate`) marks `entries.delete` destructive, but TERMINOLOGY.md says entry delete is a reversible soft-delete (trash). Also `entries.publish` collapses publish+unpublish into one action, so the spec's "unpublish is destructive" (§3.6) can't be expressed. Revisit when the permission model gains `forceDelete`/`unpublish` actions
- [ ] Close the plugin SDK descriptor-lite gap: first-party plugin sdk methods (e.g. `menus.get`) omit `mutates`, so the manifest defaults them to `mutates:true` (over-gates a future confirm gate). Declare effect hints on first-party plugin methods, and/or add typed input/output schemas (the deferred `AnyPluginSdkMethod` never-variance work)
- [ ] Add `mount` / `contentSchema` (and clarify `entryType` vs Collection) to TERMINOLOGY.md once the manifest field names stabilise
- [ ] MCP server coverage gaps (v1 projects core users/settings/media-read + 7 entry actions): (a) plugin SDK methods — need the Astro-boot plugin registry available to the standalone MCP process; (b) `media.upload`/`replace` — `File` can't cross JSON-RPC, needs a path/base64 ingest path; (c) entries long-tail (duplicate/trash/restore/emptyTrash/versions/restoreVersion/schedule). Add adapters in `transport/mcp/dispatch.ts` as each is needed
- [ ] Notifications domain not in the method manifest — the generator hardcodes the users/media/settings catalogues; the merged `notifications/` domain (and any future domain) is absent. Give each domain a registered `descriptors.ts` the generator discovers, or make catalogue discovery dynamic

### `@astromech/backups` follow-ups

- [ ] Exclude `pre-restore` snapshots from the keep-N retention count (they are currently counted against the limit)
- [ ] Turso / remote-libsql dump support — `VACUUM INTO` requires a local file; needs an alternative path for remote connections
- [ ] D1 dump/restore — Time Travel / export-to-R2 (gated on D1 driver landing)
- [ ] Postgres dump/restore — `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` (gated on Postgres driver, Phase 23)
- [ ] Admin settings UI to edit backup schedule + retention N without redeploying
- [ ] Encryption at rest for backup artifacts
- [ ] Multi-instance run-now lock — reuse the `_astromech_cron` lock so a concurrent scheduled + manual run across processes is guarded (v1 uses an in-process flag only)
- [ ] `plugin_backups_runs.startedAt` sub-second precision as a rotation tiebreak (currently second-granularity can produce ambiguous ordering)
- [ ] Cosmetic: single-page plugins render a "Backups Backups" double-heading — fix the admin page title when the plugin name and page name are identical
